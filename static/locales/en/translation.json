No matter how they choose to interact with the app, they will only ever need to sign a single transaction.\n\n**Universal Fee Abstraction** - Allows users to interact natively while being on the chain of their choice and using any tokens they want.\n\n**Wallet Abstraction** - Support MetaMask, Phantom, and other wallets as well as social or email login through one unified provider. Users never need to create a new wallet to access any apps.\n\n**Native App Experiences** - Users always feel that they are using the app natively on their chain.\n\nThis results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of \"Uniswap on Ethereum,\" \"Uniswap on Polygon,\" or \"Uniswap on Arbitrum,\" a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap.**",

With the successful voting of the governance proposal, the Push Chain mission is now on its way toward building **any chain, any user, and any app.**\n\n:::warning ⚠️ Token not live yet\nThe Push Chain token is not live, nor is any presale live. The Push Chain token is not yet named.<p />\n\n\nDo not believe anyone offering early access to the Push Chain token. All communications regarding Push Chain will be announced simultaneously from official Push channels — [Twitter / X](https://x.com/PushChain 'X handle of Push Chain'), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pushchain 'Discord of Push Chain'), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject 'Telegram of Push Chain'), [Website](https://push.org 'Push Website').\n:::\n\n<br />",

Ethereum enabled innovations for DeFi. Solana enabled fast apps and meme culture. Several L2s and new L1s are targeting other areas of concern.\n\nHowever, a blockchain that is purpose-built to enable chain abstraction and seamless interoperability in the space is still required. This chain would enable transactions from any chain (ETH, SOL, EVM or non-EVM) to power apps that can be used by **any user —** no matter their chain or wallet.

The migration will occur at a ratio of **1:15**—meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.\n\n  The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:\n\n  - Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).\n  - Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.\n  - Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.\n  - For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months — for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.\n\n  The Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.\n\n</details>\n<p />",

Instead of relying on interoperability protocols, which add complexity for both users and developers, it takes a novel approach by building a true universal blockchain that can be natively used by any user from any chain.\n\nTo achieve this, Push Chain leverages several **precompiles** which are custom modules created to:\n\n1. **Recognize** users of other chains - Universal address standard that extends the address of a user to be blockchain agnostic (based on [CAIP-10 standards](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md)).\n\n2. **Map** users to Push Chain - a Universal Executor Account (UEA) is deployed for each external-chain user. This module is used to deploy a smart account that then uses other precompiles to process the transactions.\n\n3. **Execute** universal transactions - This is done by using USV (Universal Signature Verification) and UTXV (Universal Transaction Verifier) precompiles to verify and execute signatures and transactions from other chains.\n\n4. **Abstract** away the complexities of the chain they are on - This is done by having universal gateway contracts on each chain that locks gas funds in native token of the chain (or any other compliant token) and then uses the UTXV precompiles to attribute the gas to UEA (Executor Account) and USV to execute the transaction.\n\nThis is an **extremely powerful approach** that allows users to interact with any app on Push Chain without worrying about the chain they are on or what wallet they are using as everything is abstracted away, for both the users and the developers.\n\n---",
                  "why-unique-for-users": "### Why is Push Chain unique for users?\n\nPush Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in **true full-stack interoperability**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.\n\nPush Chain's focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal (interoperable) applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use Push Chain as universal hub or do settlement between them.\n\nIt offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet / User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**\n\n---",

Push Chain avoids these bottlenecks by offering instant finality and universal fee abstraction at the base layer.\n\n- **True Shared State**  \n  To read & write the state of multiple chains within smart contracts, you need direct, protocol-level access—only available at the L1 layer.\n\nIn short, only a purpose-built L1 can unify every chain under one cohesive execution and settlement layer — without extra complexity or added trust assumptions.\n\n---",

        "qna1": {
          "question": "What is Push Chain?",
          "answer": "<1>Push Chain is a shared-state blockchain that <2>eliminates fragmentation and makes apps universal</2>.</1><1>Deploy once on Push. Users on any chain — EVM or non-EVM — use your app with their existing wallets and tokens; fees are handled under the hood.</1>"
        },
        "qna2": {
          "question": "How it works? (ELI5)",
          "answer": "<1>Use the wallet you already have — Push handles the cross-chain bits behind the scenes.</1><1>1. <2>Start anywhere.</2> Use any wallet on any chain — no network switching.</1><1>2. <2>Sign once.</2> Pay with a token you already hold; we set aside the fee on your home chain.</1><1>3. <2>We route it.</2> A linked account on Push (still yours) forwards your call to the app — non-custodial.</1><1>4. <2>You're always you.</2> We match your home-chain wallet to your linked account so actions are correctly verified and attributed to you on Push.</1><1>5. <2>Done fast.</2> The app runs on Push; fees are handled under the hood. No bridges, no new wallet.</1><1>This is how users on any chain can use the same app deployed on Push Chain — making apps truly universal.</1>"
        },
        "qna3": {
          "question": "Do I need a different wallet or gas token?",
          "answer": "<1><2>No.</2></1><1><2>Keep your wallet.</2> Use the wallet you already have — no new wallet or account.</1><1><2>Pay in what you hold.</2> Fees can be paid in the tokens you already have on your home chain; we handle conversion behind the scenes.</1><1><2>No network switching.</2> Stay on your home chain — no bridging just to get a gas token.</1><1><2>Non-custodial.</2> You sign every action; Push never holds your keys.</1><1><2>Under the hood.</2> The network settles fees in $PC automatically — you don't need to manage it.</1>"
        },
        "qna4": {
          "question": "How is this different from bridges or messaging layers?",
          "answer": "<1><2>Short Answer</2>: Push is where your app runs. Bridges/messaging just move tokens or messages between chains which complicates everything for the user and developers.</1><1><2>Single home vs many clones.</2> With bridges/messaging you deploy per chain and sync via messages. On Push you deploy once; everyone hits the same contract and shared state.</1><1><2>No wrapped assets or mandatory bridging.</2> Users stay on their home chain and pay with what they already hold; we handle routing and fee conversion under the hood.</1><1><2>Unified identity & verification.</2> We accept signatures from any wallet/chain and attribute them to the same user on Push — non-custodial.</1><1><2>Fewer moving parts.</2> No cross-chain approval dance, no gas-token hunting, no glue contracts to keep in sync.</1><1><2>Bridges introduce complexity. Chain-native interop solves it.</2> Bridges require complex engineering effort, time, audit cost and additional infrastructure. Chain-native interop just works as your app natively inherits it.</1><1>Result: simpler apps, one source of truth, and a UX that feels like one chain — even when users aren't.</1>"
        },
        "qna5": {
          "question": "Is it EVM-only? Which chains are supported?",
          "answer": "<1><2>No, Push supports both EVM and non-EVM chains.</2> Though it is EVM-first for deployment, users from any chains (including non-EVM) can use your app as if they are using it natively.</1>\n<1><2>Deploy once. Interop everywhere.</2> Write and deploy standard EVM contracts on Push (Solidity/Vyper). Tooling stays the same.</1>\n<1><2>Users from any chain.</2> Ethereum and major EVM L2s work natively. Non-EVM users (e.g., Solana) sign with their home wallets; we verify and route under the hood — no network switching.</1>\n<1><2>Supported today.</2> See the live list of supported chains → <3>Supported Chains</3>.</1><1><2>Expanding coverage.</2> We're adding more chains constantly.

        },
        "qna6": {
          "question": "How fast is it and what do fees look like?",
          "answer": "<1><2>Speed.</2> Designed for ~1s confirmations on Push Chain with determinitis finality and fast UX feedback. For universal transactions, It depends per chain but most modern blockchains should take ~2-3s confirmations or less. Check live metrics on <3>🍩 Donut Testnet</3>.</1><1><2>Fee model.</2> You see the fee in the token you choose to pay; the network settles in $PC under the hood.</1><1><2>Typical costs.</2> Typical fees is less than <2>$0.001</2> per transaction. though, it varies by contract complexity, price of the token and network load. You get an exact quote before you sign.</1>",

It enables developers to deploy once, and instantly become available for users on any chain, whether EVM or Non-EVM (including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin among others). It is 100% EVM compatible, Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows users to interact with the apps deployed on Push Chain from any chain, as they natively do on their own chain.",
