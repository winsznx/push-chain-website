                  "overview": "## Overview\n\nIn late 2024, the Push community voted to approve the launch of Push Chain, a shared state layer 1 blockchain designed to enable the development of universal applications and eliminate fragmentation across web3.\n\nPush Chain is a purpose-built layer that connects L1s, L2s, and L3s with near-instant finality and true scalability, which solves the fundamental issue with web3 applications: fragmentation. With the successful voting of the governance proposal, the Push Chain mission is now on its way toward building **any chain, any user, and any app.**\n\n:::warning ⚠️ Token not live yet\nThe Push Chain token is not live, nor is any presale live. The Push Chain token is not yet named.<p />\n\n\nDo not believe anyone offering early access to the Push Chain token. All communications regarding Push Chain will be announced simultaneously from official Push channels — [Twitter / X](https://x.com/PushChain 'X handle of Push Chain'), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pushchain 'Discord of Push Chain'), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject 'Telegram of Push Chain'), [Website](https://push.org 'Push Website').\n:::\n\n<br />",
                  "vision": "## What is the Vision of Push Chain?\n\nAll blockchains have proven particularly useful for specific apps and use cases. Bitcoin enabled smart money. Ethereum enabled innovations for DeFi. Solana enabled fast apps and meme culture. Several L2s and new L1s are targeting other areas of concern.\n\nHowever, a blockchain that is purpose-built to enable chain abstraction and seamless interoperability in the space is still required. This chain would enable transactions from any chain (ETH, SOL, EVM or non-EVM) to power apps that can be used by **any user —** no matter their chain or wallet. This is the chain of **Universal Apps**. This is Push Chain!",
                  "innovation": "### Built on innovation to eliminate blockchain isolation!\n\nPush Chain is revolutionary for both users and developers as it creates an environment for any developer to deploy their universal app in hours via a single universal smart contract deployment.\n\nIt also enables users to transact from the comfort, convenience, and choice of their ecosystem, no matter where the app resides.\n\nUnder the hood, this is achieved by:\n\n- Ability to do **transactions from any chain**\n- **Universal Fee & Wallet Abstraction** to enable users to use any chain, any wallet and pay in any token\n- **Universal Smart Contract** to enable devs to deploy instant interop apps in minutes\n- **Shared State** to read data from other blockchain\n- **Programmable Solver** to write data to any other chain\n\nAll of this enables a **Universal Execution Layer** to allow users of any chain to access and interact with the same app.",
                  "fit": "### Where does Push Chain fit in?\n\nPush chain fits **every project…** **on every chain!**\n\n- **It allows developers** from any chain to create seamless full interop apps that can be used from any chain, via any wallet.<br />\n- **It allows users** the freedom to interact with the wallet of their choice or have a seamless signless experience via Push Universal Wallet with social login.<br />\n- **It allows shared app experiences** where users of all chains can come together and engage with universal DeFi, unified gaming, universal NFT, universal Governance, etc.<br />",
                  "use-cases": "### What can be built on Push Chain?\n\nPush Chain brings seamless interoperability and unifies all L1s, L2s, & L3s and therefore is poised to become the playground of innovation and interop. You can build existing web3 use cases such as:\n\n![Primary use cases of Push Chain](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/tokenomics/usecasesmain.webp)\n\nOr you can better web3 and create innovations:\n\n![Consumer use cases of Push Chain](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/tokenomics/consumerusecases.webp)\n\nOr you can see some popular app examples and to take inspiration from:\n\n![Popular app examples on Push Chain](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/tokenomics/popularapps.webp)",
                  "token-utility": "### What is the utility of the Push Chain token?\n\n1. **Staking & Validation** <br />\nThe token is used for staking to secure the network and participate in consensus. Validators and delegators earn rewards for their participation.\n\n2. **Transaction Fees** <br />\nThe token serves as the primary method for network fees for transactions and app usage.\n\n3. **Universal Fee Abstraction** <br />\nThe token enables users to pay fees in any token (ETH, SOL, USDC, etc.) while the protocol handles conversion behind the scenes.\n\n4. **Governance** <br />\nToken holders can participate in protocol governance, voting on upgrades, parameter changes, and ecosystem decisions.",
                  "deflationary-design": "### Deflationary Design\n\n1. **Transaction Fee Burn** <br />\nA portion of transaction fees collected in the native Push Chain token are burned, reducing the total supply over time.\n\n2. **Cross Chain Burn** <br />\nUsing Universal Fee Abstractions, a part of the fee collected on other blockchain's native token (ETH, SOL) is swapped for Push Chain native token and burned.\n\nThis ensures a deflationary blockchain design that burns tokens as the network and the transactions that happen on it grow. This design enables the creation of an incentivized, sustainable long-term future for Push Chain and all its participants.",
                  "migration-details": "### Migration Details\n\nPush Chain is the result of years of learning from building the leading notification and communication protocol of web3, which was one of the first consumer apps for crypto.\n\nOwing to this, apart from the airdrop allocated (see details below) to Push Chain users, creators, developers and ecosystem partners, **there is also a migration drop reserved for the $PUSH holders** (which was the native token of Push Protocol).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  <b>Migration details for existing $PUSH token holders</b>\n\n  </summary>\n\n  **For existing $PUSH token holders**, the Push Chain tokenomics proposal allocates 15% of the total Push Chain token supply specifically for migration. The migration will occur at a ratio of **1:15**—meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.\n\n  The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:\n\n  - Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).\n  - Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.\n  - Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.\n  - For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months — for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.\n\n  The Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.\n\n</details>\n<p />",
                  "airdrop-details": "### Airdrop Details\n\nAdditionally, the tokenomics proposal allocates 10% of the total Push Chain token supply for airdrops to past and present Push Protocol application users (notifications, messaging, chat). Along with new users, creators, developers, and ecosystem partners of Push Chain.\n\n<br />",
                  "token-distribution": "## Token Distribution Details\n\nThe total supply of Push Chain tokens is proposed at **10 billion**, distributed as follows:\n\n![Push Chain Tokenomics](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/tokenomics/vestingpc.webp)\n\n![Push Chain Tokenomics Vesting Details](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/tokenomics/vestingdetailspc.webp)\n\n1. Airdrop distributions begin at TGE, but will happen over the course of multiple seasons.\n2. Core Contributors have a 12-month delay, followed by 24-month vesting.\n3. Push Labs Treasury has a 36-month vesting.\n4. Investors have 24-month linear vesting.\n5. Community and Ecosystem Reserves has a 13.5% unlock at TGE, followed by 36-month vesting.\n\n<br />",
